However, I tend to mess up my setup when I amend or rebase when working with the local site.
Since I like to keep things simple, I have switched to keeping the generated site in a separate git repo, which I deploy by manually pushing to github pages.
The benefit of this is that I get to review the changes manually before deploying to the live site.</description></item><item><title>Travel Blogging Setup</title><link>//www.stou.dk/2014/11/travel-blogging-setup/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2014 20:42:55 +0800</pubDate><guid>//www.stou.dk/2014/11/travel-blogging-setup/</guid><description>I am currently travelling with my family in South East asia. The trip is planned to last about one year, so before we left home (Denmark) I set up a blog to use as a diary for ourselves and to keep friends and family updated while we are away.
Since I like to do a little programming in my spare time, I decided to use Hugo as my blogging platform.</description></item></channel></rss>
